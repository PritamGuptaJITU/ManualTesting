# Software Quality Assurance (SQA) and Manual Testing

## 📜 Introduction
Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a systematic process to ensure that software meets predefined standards and requirements. Manual testing plays a crucial role in verifying software functionality by simulating user behavior without automation.

## 🧰 Key Components of SQA

1. **Requirements Analysis**:
   - Understanding what the software is supposed to do.
   - Identifying potential risks early.

2. **Test Planning**:
   - Creating a detailed test plan outlining scope, objectives, resources, and schedule.

3. **Test Execution**:
   - Performing manual test cases to validate software functionality.
   - Reporting and documenting bugs.

4. **Defect Management**:
   - Tracking and resolving issues to ensure quality.

## 🛠️ Manual Testing in SQA

### What is Manual Testing?
Manual testing is the process of manually validating software for defects, ensuring it behaves as expected. Testers execute test cases without using automated tools.

### Key Stages of Manual Testing:
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components or modules.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensuring different modules work together.
- **System Testing**: Validating the entire system as a whole.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Ensuring the software meets end-user requirements.

### Advantages:
- Detects user interface issues.
- Simulates real-world usage scenarios.
- Cost-effective for small projects.

### Challenges:
- Time-consuming for large-scale projects.
- Prone to human error.
